# Word-Search

This program loads a list of words and a word search grid from a txt file and solves it printing out the coordinates for each of the words.

The format of the file is a list of comma separated words on the first line of the file. Then a grid of comma separated leters.

The file read from is "wordsearch.txt". update this file to change the word search that is being solved.
